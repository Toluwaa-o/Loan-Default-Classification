# Detecting Fraudulent Online Payments Using Machine Learning Models

This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent online payments. The project aims to enhance fraud detection capabilities using various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Overview

Online payment fraud is a significant challenge for financial institutions and businesses. This project explores how machine learning can be leveraged to identify fraudulent transactions early, thereby reducing financial losses and improving security measures.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Exploring and cleaning the dataset to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training different machine learning models, including XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as F1 Score, ROC-AUC Score, and accuracy.
- **Feature Importance**: Analyzing important features that contribute to detecting fraudulent transactions.
- **Deployment**: Considerations for deploying the best-performing model in a production environment.

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project contains information about online payment transactions, including transaction features and labels indicating fraudulent or non-fraudulent transactions.
